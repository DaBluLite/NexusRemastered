# Nexus Remastered
The theme that never came to be, and predecessor to Cyan, remastered and better than before

So, Cyan 1 got discontinued and Cyan 2 officially replaced it, so, what now? Well, Cyan 1 might have been discontinued, but its legacy goes on in the form of Nexus Remastered, a modern spin on Cyan's prequel, updated, improved and ready to blend 
the simplicity of Nexus and the powerful UI/UX of Cyan
